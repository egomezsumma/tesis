We propose a framework for solving this problem using random forest regression to relate patches in the low-quality data set to voxel values in the high quality data set.

The first example, super-resolution of diffusion tensor images (DTIs), enhances spatial resolution of standard data sets with information from the high-resolution HCP data. The second, parameter mapping, constructs neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI) parameter maps, which usually require specialist data sets with two b-values, from standard single-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data sets with b = 1000 s mm− 2. Experiments quantify the improvement against alternative image reconstructions in comparison to ground truth from the HCP data set in both examples and demonstrate efficacy on a standard data set.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre-lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna-tional conference, * * * , 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Many recent high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) reconstruction techniques have been introduced to infer an orientation distribution function (ODF) of the underlying tissue structure. These methods are more often based on a single-shell (one b-value) acquisition and can only recover angular structure information contained in the ensemble average propagator (EAP) describing the three-dimensional (3D) average diffusion process of water molecules. The EAP can thus provide richer information about complex tissue microstructure properties than the ODF by also considering the radial part of the diffusion signal. In this paper, we present a novel technique for analytical EAP reconstruction from multiple q-shell acquisitions. The solution is based on a Laplace equation by part estimation between the diffusion signal for each shell acquisition. This simplifies greatly the Fourier integral relating diffusion signal and EAP, which leads to an analytical, linear and compact EAP reconstruction. An important part of the paper is dedicated to validate the diffusion signal estimation and EAP reconstruction on real datasets from ex vivo phantoms. We also illustrate multiple q-shell diffusion propagator imaging (mq-DPI) on a real in vivo human brain and perform a qualitative comparison against state-of-the-art diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) on the same subject. mq-DPI is shown to reconstruct robust EAP from only several different b-value shells and less diffusion measurements than DSI.

Diffusion-weighted images using strong gradient strengths (b values of 1413 s/mm2) displayed a significant relative hyperintensity in ischemic regions as early as 45 min after onset of ischemia whereas T2-weighted spin-echo images failed to clearly demonstrate brain injury up to 2-3 h postocclusion. Signal intensity ratios (SIR) of ischemic to normal tissues were greater in the diffusion-weighted images at all times than in either TE 80 or TE 160 ms T2-weighted MR images. Diffusion- and T2-weighted SIR did not correlate for the first 1-2 h postocclusion. Good correlation was found between diffusion-weighted SIR and ischemic disturbances of energy metabolism as detected by 31P and 1H MR spectroscopy. Diffusion-weighted hyperintensity in ischemic tissues may be temperature-related, due to rapid accumulation of diffusion-restricted water in the intracellular space (cytotoxic edema) resulting from the breakdown of the transmembrane pump and/or to microscopic brain pulsations.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide invaluable information about the structure of different tissue types in the brain. Standard dMRI acquisitions facilitate a proper analysis (e.g. tracing) of medium-to-large white matter bundles. However, smaller fiber bundles connecting very small cortical or sub-cortical regions cannot be traced accurately in images with large voxel sizes. Yet, the ability to trace such fiber bundles is critical for several applications such as deep brain stimulation and neurosurgery. In this work, we propose a novel acquisition and reconstruction scheme for obtaining high spatial resolution dMRI images using multiple low resolution (LR) images, which is effective in reducing acquisition time while improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed method called compressed-sensing super resolution reconstruction (CS-SRR), uses multiple overlapping thick-slice dMRI volumes that are under-sampled in q-space to reconstruct diffusion signal with complex orientations. The proposed method combines the twin concepts of compressed sensing and super-resolution to model the diffusion signal (at a given b-value) in a basis of spherical ridgelets with total-variation (TV) regularization to account for signal correlation in neighboring voxels. A computationally efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is introduced for solving the CS-SRR problem. The performance of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated on several in-vivo human data sets including a true SRR scenario. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for reconstructing sub-millimeter super resolution dMRI data with very good data fidelity in clinically feasible acquisition time.},

abstract = {Models of diffusion MRI within a voxel are useful for making inferences about the properties of the tissue and inferring fiber orientation distribution used by tractography algorithms. A useful model must fit the data accurately. However, evaluations of model-accuracy of commonly used models have not been published before. Here, we evaluate model-accuracy of the two main classes of diffusion MRI models. The diffusion tensor model (DTM) summarizes diffusion as a 3-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Sparse fascicle models (SFM) summarize the signal as a sum of signals originating from a collection of fascicles oriented in different directions. We use cross-validation to assess model-accuracy at different gradient amplitudes (b-values) throughout the white matter. Specifically, we fit each model to all the white matter voxels in one data set and then use the model to predict a second, independent data set. This is the first evaluation of model-accuracy of these models. In most of the white matter the DTM predicts the data more accurately than test-retest reliability; SFM model-accuracy is higher than test-retest reliability and also higher than the DTM model-accuracy, particularly for measurements with (a) a b-value above 1000 in locations containing fiber crossings, and (b) in the regions of the brain surrounding the optic radiations. The SFM also has better parameter-validity: it more accurately estimates the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in each voxel, which is useful for fiber tracking.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion imaging provides an exquisitely sensitive probe of tis- sue microstructure. Owing to the microscopic length scale of diffusion in biological tissues, diffusion imaging can reveal histological architecture irresolvable by conven- tional magnetic resonance imaging methods. However, diffusion imaging methods to date have chiefly been based on analytical models of the underlying diffusion pro- cess. For example, diffusion tensor imaging assumes homogeneous Gaussian diffusion within each voxel, an assumption which is clearly invalid for the vast majority of the brain at presently achievable voxel resolutions. In this thesis I developed a diffusion imaging method capable of measuring the microscopic diffusion function within each voxel. In contrast to previous approaches to diffusion imaging, the method presented here does not require any assumptions on the underlying diffusion function. The model-independent approach can resolve com- plex intravoxel tissue structure including fiber crossing and fiber divergence within a single voxel. The method is capable of resolving not only deep white matter inter- sections, but also composite tissue structure at the cortical margin, and fiber-specific degeneration in neurodegenerative pathology. In sum, the approach can reveal com- plex intravoxel tissue structure previously thought to be beyond the scope of diffusion imaging methodology.},

abstract = {Diffusion measurements in the human central nervous system are complex to characterize and a broad spectrum of methods have been proposed. In this study, a comprehensive diffusion encoding and analysis approach, hybrid diffusion imaging (HYDI), is described. The HYDI encoding scheme is composed of multiple concentric "shells" of constant diffusion weighting, which may be used to characterize the signal behavior with low, moderate and high diffusion weighting. HYDI facilitates the application of multiple data analyses strategies including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), multi-exponential diffusion measurements, diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and q-ball imaging (QBI). These different analysis strategies may provide complementary information. DTI measures (mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) may be estimated from either data in the inner shells or the entire HYDI data. Fast and slow diffusivities were estimated using a nonlinear least squares bi-exponential fit on geometric means of the HYDI shells. DSI measurements from the entire HYDI data yield empirical model-independent diffusion information and are well-suited for characterizing tissue regions with complex diffusion behavior. DSI measurements were characterized using the zero displacement probability and the mean-squared displacement. The outermost HYDI shell was analyzed using QBI analysis to estimate the orientation distribution function (ODF), which is useful for characterizing the directions of multiple fiber groups within a voxel. In this study, an HYDI encoding scheme with 102 diffusion-weighted measurements was obtained over most of the human cerebrum in under 30??min. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
