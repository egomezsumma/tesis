abstract = {This paper introduces image quality transfer. The aim is to learn the fine structural detail of medical images from high quality data sets acquired with long acquisition times or from bespoke devices and transfer that information to enhance lower quality data sets from standard acquisitions. We propose a framework for solving this problem using random forest regression to relate patches in the low-quality data set to voxel values in the high quality data set. Two examples in diffusion MRI demonstrate the idea. In both cases, we learn from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set, which uses an hour of acquisition time per subject, just for diffusion imaging, using custom built scanner hardware and rapid imaging techniques. The first example, super-resolution of diffusion tensor images (DTIs), enhances spatial resolution of standard data sets with information from the high-resolution HCP data. The second, parameter mapping, constructs neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI) parameter maps, which usually require specialist data sets with two b-values, from standard single-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data sets with b = 1000 s mmâˆ’ 2. Experiments quantify the improvement against alternative image reconstructions in comparison to ground truth from the HCP data set in both examples and demonstrate efficacy on a standard data set.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide invaluable information about the structure of different tissue types in the brain. Standard dMRI acquisitions facilitate a proper analysis (e.g. tracing) of medium-to-large white matter bundles. However, smaller fiber bundles connecting very small cortical or sub-cortical regions cannot be traced accurately in images with large voxel sizes. Yet, the ability to trace such fiber bundles is critical for several applications such as deep brain stimulation and neurosurgery. In this work, we propose a novel acquisition and reconstruction scheme for obtaining high spatial resolution dMRI images using multiple low resolution (LR) images, which is effective in reducing acquisition time while improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed method called compressed-sensing super resolution reconstruction (CS-SRR), uses multiple overlapping thick-slice dMRI volumes that are under-sampled in q-space to reconstruct diffusion signal with complex orientations. The proposed method combines the twin concepts of compressed sensing and super-resolution to model the diffusion signal (at a given b-value) in a basis of spherical ridgelets with total-variation (TV) regularization to account for signal correlation in neighboring voxels. A computationally efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is introduced for solving the CS-SRR problem. The performance of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated on several in-vivo human data sets including a true SRR scenario. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for reconstructing sub-millimeter super resolution dMRI data with very good data fidelity in clinically feasible acquisition time.},
