abstract = {Abstract The recovery of microstructure-related features of the brain's white matter is a current challenge in diffusion MRI. To robustly estimate these important features from multi-shell diffusion {\{}MRI{\}} data, we propose to analytically regularize the coefficient estimation of the Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP)-MRI method using the norm of the Laplacian of the reconstructed signal. We first compare our approach, which we call MAPL, with competing, state-of-the-art functional basis approaches. We show that it outperforms the original MAP-MRI implementation and the recently proposed modified Spherical Polar Fourier (mSPF) basis with respect to signal fitting and reconstruction of the Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) and Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) in noisy, sparsely sampled data of a physical phantom with reference gold standard data. Then, to reduce the variance of parameter estimation using multi-compartment tissue models, we propose to use MAPL's signal fitting and extrapolation as a preprocessing step. We study the effect of {\{}MAPL{\}} on the estimation of axon diameter using a simplified Axcaliber model and axonal dispersion using the Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model. We show the positive effect of using it as a preprocessing step in estimating and reducing the variances of these parameters in the Corpus Callosum of six different subjects of the {\{}MGH{\}} Human Connectome Project. Finally, we correlate the estimated axon diameter, dispersion and restricted volume fractions with Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and clearly show that changes in {\{}FA{\}} significantly correlate with changes in all estimated parameters. Overall, we illustrate the potential of using a well-regularized functional basis together with multi-compartment approaches to recover important microstructure tissue parameters with much less variability, thus contributing to the challenge of better understanding microstructure-related features of the brain's white matter. },

abstract = {This paper introduces image quality transfer. The aim is to learn the fine structural detail of medical images from high quality data sets acquired with long acquisition times or from bespoke devices and transfer that information to enhance lower quality data sets from standard acquisitions. We propose a framework for solving this problem using random forest regression to relate patches in the low-quality data set to voxel values in the high quality data set. Two examples in diffusion MRI demonstrate the idea. In both cases, we learn from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set, which uses an hour of acquisition time per subject, just for diffusion imaging, using custom built scanner hardware and rapid imaging techniques. The first example, super-resolution of diffusion tensor images (DTIs), enhances spatial resolution of standard data sets with information from the high-resolution HCP data. The second, parameter mapping, constructs neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI) parameter maps, which usually require specialist data sets with two b-values, from standard single-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data sets with b = 1000 s mmâˆ’ 2. Experiments quantify the improvement against alternative image reconstructions in comparison to ground truth from the HCP data set in both examples and demonstrate efficacy on a standard data set.},

abstract = {Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide invaluable information about the structure of different tissue types in the brain. Standard dMRI acquisitions facilitate a proper analysis (e.g. tracing) of medium-to-large white matter bundles. However, smaller fiber bundles connecting very small cortical or sub-cortical regions cannot be traced accurately in images with large voxel sizes. Yet, the ability to trace such fiber bundles is critical for several applications such as deep brain stimulation and neurosurgery. In this work, we propose a novel acquisition and reconstruction scheme for obtaining high spatial resolution dMRI images using multiple low resolution (LR) images, which is effective in reducing acquisition time while improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed method called compressed-sensing super resolution reconstruction (CS-SRR), uses multiple overlapping thick-slice dMRI volumes that are under-sampled in q-space to reconstruct diffusion signal with complex orientations. The proposed method combines the twin concepts of compressed sensing and super-resolution to model the diffusion signal (at a given b-value) in a basis of spherical ridgelets with total-variation (TV) regularization to account for signal correlation in neighboring voxels. A computationally efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is introduced for solving the CS-SRR problem. The performance of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated on several in-vivo human data sets including a true SRR scenario. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for reconstructing sub-millimeter super resolution dMRI data with very good data fidelity in clinically feasible acquisition time.},

abstract = {In Magnetic Resonance Imaging, image resolution is limited by several factors such as hardware or time 
constraints. In many cases, the acquired images have to be upsampled to match a specific resolution. In such cases, 
image interpolation techniques have been traditionally applied. However, traditional interpolation techniques are not 
able to recover high frequency information of the underlying high resolution data. In this paper, a new upsampling 
method is proposed to recover some of this high frequency information by using a data-adaptive patch-based 
reconstruction in combination with a subsampling coherence constraint. The proposed method has been evaluated on 
synthetic and real clinical cases and compared with traditional interpolation methods. The proposed method is shown to 
outperform classical interpolation methods compared in terms of quantitative measures and visual observation.},

related to the echo intensity in an NMR spin-echo experiment. This relationship is used to design 
experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate is validated using isotropic and anisotropic 
media, i.e., water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors are made in diffusion 
NMR spectroscopy and imaging of anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff are 
ignored, most notably the loss of information needed to determine fiber orientation. Estimation of 
Deff provides the theoretical basis for a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor imaging, which provides 
information about tissue microstructure and its physiologic state not contained in scalar quantities 
such as T1, T2, proton density, or the scalar apparent diffusion constant.},

@article{Zhang2012,
abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a 
practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and 
axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide 
more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor 
imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical 
scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed 
technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell 
high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An 
index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We 
evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. 
Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion 
estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of 
each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated 
with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated 
more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The 
optimized protocol takes about 30. min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical 
clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the 
acquisition time to just 10. min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This 
demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such 
as neonatal and dementia imaging. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The primary goal of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) is to delineate the typical 
patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the healthy adult human brain. However, we 
know that there are important individual differences in such patterns of connectivity, with evidence 
that this variability is associated with alterations in important cognitive and behavioral variables 
that affect real world function. The HCP data will be a critical stepping-off point for future 
studies that will examine how variation in human structural and functional connectivity play a role 
in adult and pediatric neurological and psychiatric disorders that account for a huge amount of 
public health resources. Thus, the HCP is collecting behavioral measures of a range of motor, 
sensory, cognitive and emotional processes that will delineate a core set of functions relevant to 
understanding the relationship between brain connectivity and human behavior. In addition, the HCP 
is using task-fMRI (tfMRI) to help delineate the relationships between individual differences in the 
neurobiological substrates of mental processing and both functional and structural connectivity, as 
well as to help characterize and validate the connectivity analyses to be conducted on the 
structural and functional connectivity data. This paper describes the logic and rationale behind the 
development of the behavioral, individual difference, and tfMRI batteries and provides preliminary 
data on the patterns of activation associated with each of the fMRI tasks, at both group and 
individual levels.},
